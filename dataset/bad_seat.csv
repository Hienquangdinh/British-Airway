The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average.",Boeing 777,300
1,True,2024-03-01,United Kingdom,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,2.0,1,no,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience.",Boeing 787,
2,False,2024-02-01,Canada,,Business,1.0,1,no,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price.",,

21,True,2023-12-01,United Kingdom,,Family Leisure,2.0,2,no,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked.",,

It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time.

Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg.

However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic.

39,True,2023-11-01,United States,Boeing 777,Business,1.0,1,no,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost.

Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays.

We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was.

They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn’t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy.

How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off.

Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU.

Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips.

We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times.

First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out.

311,True,2023-01-01,United States,"A320, A380",Family Leisure,1.0,1,no,"Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.",A320, A380

Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space.

My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better.

The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service.

British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded.

I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit.

VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that.

It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective.

Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy.

BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing.

Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you.

Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile.

Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation.

Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes.

Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable).

My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way.

That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines.

No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off.

I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.",A319,320

The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago.

After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ).

Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats.

Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times.

I flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfort. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. I'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. There is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. So your feet are raised. The armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. Every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. The hydraulics must be connected. It was very annoying. The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. It was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. I had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). The divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. So for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. Very awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. It wanted to go back into the column and so I had to watch my movie at an angle. The food. Well. The fillet streak was tough and dry. I had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and they did a much better job. The selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. You are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. I had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! Not ideal with some turbulence. There was also no wifi even though BA advertise as such. Apparently the Boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. The layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. The 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the TV's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal.

Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers.

The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate.

The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds.

I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits.

Seat was the absolute worst part of this flight, as it is narrow, too hard to have a nice sleep, and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a ""wall"" on one side and being exposed to people/trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side; once flat it is a little short too (even for me, I'm 180cm high, no giant here) and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible, therefore you have literally no space to store anything, not even your glasses if you wear them. Food was just ok (I still can't understand how BA can run out of entrée options in Business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working.

Going to India this time, I decided to go east, via LHR and BA seemed a good idea. I will not do so again. I specifically booked all the flights through BA so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline"" - ""But BA did all the booking!"". Blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually phoned and got the PNR and checked myself in with a boarding pass. Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. When I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. The fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. Essentially despite BA being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. The flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. On the way back - forget it. Firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! When I asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the plane. I was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. The breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever had. The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. I'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I'm not fat. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta and American Airlines internationals are much better. Generally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. I'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. Its not because they are so much cheaper than others. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli.

At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'.

The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all.

Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted.

Balsamic honey glazed chicken for mains was a disaster. Dried out. Unedible. FAs made up my bed. It was hard as rock and very uncomfortable. I slept not for one minute. Nor did my wife.

Worn carpets that really should be replaced. The usual cheap amenities bag rounded off the usual poor experience with BA 1st Class. The IFE was very dated. One wonders if the BA board every think of flying with an Asian or Middle Eastern carrier to discover what true 1st Class should look like. FAs - apart from the rude one - were great.

The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was!

The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round, then a dinner service (BA872) which was edible but slopping / dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. Are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger? In all, the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return - what a joke! Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet! The flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg room. The meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. The steward offered a shriveled chicken salad (leg meat skewers), or get this, a boxed sandwich. I actually had to ask if that was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied ""so who's eaten all the food?"" He laughed and actually said we were lucky, and if I had any food with me could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete drama but I won't go there on this ocassion).

What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up.

Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here).

Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats.

Very nice mezza, nice soup and spicy Middle Eastern style chicken; not bad at all. Champagne very basic and Krug has long vanished from British Airways routes. Cabin crew were terrific – faultless.

Staff were on another planet as far as service was concerned - abrupt, unsmiling and intent on getting service over as quickly as possible, before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley. Using the call button was a waste of time midflight, I guess they were all resting by then. I know that on Air China the wine may be served rather warm, a cold beer is hard to get, and staff language skills are limited to standard phrases, but their staff are cheerful, enthusiastic to serve customers - and their business seats a lot more comfortable. The British Airways motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation.

The seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only BA boss to improve things) are cramped, claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight. Because of the seat design, there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the ""good"" airlines now offer in Business class. The cabin staff were frankly laughable, sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive Japanese FA. British Airways is trading off a very distant reputation, and it seems that most British customers select them simply because they are British - anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that BA is now well down the quality list, and it is about time Skytrax downgraded them to 3-Star Airline maximum - they do not meet 4-Star. BA markets itself as this slick, British style, when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now, and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline - many UK companies and UK departments stipulate BA as a No 1 choice, and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. If you're proud to be British, I would recommend you give BA a wake-up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards.

Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets.

The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part.

However by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. Their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. After the first meal service (an uninspiring Chicken Curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the BA website about the supposed 'enhanced' dining experience of World Traveller Plus) calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. It seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. In stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on Qantas to Bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on BA was extremely disappointing. Our advice: don't waste your money on BA World Traveller Plus.,,
3021,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,LGW-HER. A320 on one of BA's new tourist-orientated routes. Sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny-pinching 'new' Club Europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. If this is the way BA are going it doesn't make sense to pay the extra. They really should think again about their premium service.,,
3037,False,,India,,,1.0,1,no,"BA 138 13/5/2015. BA 273 13/5/2015. Just completed my first BA Flight in Club World. The experience can be summed up in a single word - ""pathetic"". The flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". The crew was totally indifferent. The light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge. Will never travel BA again.",,
3038,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,yes,LGW - Antigua - LGW. Easy check in at the Club World desk and then quickly through security etc. Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. The return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference. Overall another good experience with BA bar the few issues that I have mentioned.,,
3039,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,Over the last couple of years I have travelled to China by Emirates KLM Virgin Atlantic and BA. The next time I travel BA will be my last choice. I got the impression from the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity. Their lounges are basic and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. If you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.,,
3046,False,,Belgium,,,1.0,5,yes,BRU-LHR-YYZ: CLUB Europe - Club World; This time again check-in was smooth with friendly ground staff the best croissant in this lounge. Boarding was easy friendly cabin crew was waiting for us to take jackets. Hot towels tasting breakfast landed on time. This short flight 10/10. Security in Heathrow was horror but I prefer the horror of waiting than the horror of terror. First lounge was a breeze. Boarding for the flight to Toronto was with busses driving us to the Dreamliner. Indeed the business seats are smaller. It really felt bad. The flight was not comfortable at all as I left the plane with pain in the back and shoulder. The crew were excellent the food was excellent and the screens are improved. But the space you have is really a shame. As a gold member I fly often business or first but the club world seats in the Dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all. I will avoid this plane in future. I am so happy I will fly back in a 777.,,
3055,False,,Argentina,,,2.0,3,yes,LHR-EZE business class on board B777. Tired old cabin old IFE system. Business class seat layout cramped and uncomfortable with forward and rear facing seats. However cabin crew deserve praise for their excellent attention.,,
3056,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,yes,Pisa-LGW. Lounge at Pisa is a shared set up and rather nice. Spacious and colourful. Comfortable seats. Much better than hanging around the terminal. We have used it a few times. Plenty of booze. Mediocre snacks. No food. Checked in online. Baggage drop off. No problems. Plane was parked on the tarmac. Had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish I wasn't going home). This is very annoying - because the whole point over flying BA instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the Irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. This has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (More BA cuts I wonder) Plane was a newish A319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. All clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. Seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. Afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed I happily drank three Gin and T's. FA's very pleasant and friendly. Even offered me a 4th G&T which I declined. All in all a good experience. (seats could be much better though). Landed ahead of schedule.,,
3066,False,,United Arab Emirates,,,1.0,2,no,IST-LHR the so called business class is a joke and is virtually indistinguishable from economy on any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline properly there is no sort of entertainment whatsoever on a four hour flight. Having flown on Turkish Royal Jordanian Emirates and Cathay Pacific in the past couple of months only made the contrast more striking. Never again!,,
3081,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,Flew Gatwick to Kingston 13/3/15 return 27/3/15 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. Not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. Need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together BA did not even try to accommodate us. Not worth the money Virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. Will never travel BA long haul again be warned don't waste your money.,,
3083,False,,Australia,,,1.0,4,yes,April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again. The seat is a real let down.,,
3087,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,BA 730 LHR-GVA 20 Apr 15. Are fooling no-one with their new Club Europe Business Class seats - they look nice - but are too close together providing extremely poor legroom! As a regular London to Geneva traveller I will go back to flying Swiss! The decision to change this is almost as bad as the stupid decision to have seats facing backwards in Club World where you have to face strangers and climb over others to get to your seat. If you can't fly First Class with BA choose another airline until they remedy these issues because their Business Class product is rubbish!,,
3089,False,,Australia,,,2.0,3,no,LHR-BKK in Club on B777. Fourth long haul leg on BA in the last month and this was by far the best flight. That said I still think the product is disappointing. I'm the camp that says the seats are highly uncomfortable. They are far too narrow as an average sized person still finds their arms draped across the arm rests while trying to sleep. You simply can't keep your arms by your side. As such little to no sleep. IFE outdated and awful.,,
3093,False,,Turkey,,,1.0,1,no,17 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Lisbon. A total waste of money. The food was horrible. A couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. There was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. The seat pitch was pathetic and could not even get a rest. I am very disappointed that I did not choose TAP instead of British.,,
3099,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,no,"10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it.",,
3102,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,no,We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. We will never fly with BA again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.,,
3104,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,no,BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.,,
3110,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,yes,Travelled MAN-LHR-ATL and back. Boarding at MAN chaotic with queue in a corridor (probably not BA's fault). Delayed departure from LHR on a very full 777-200. Food and wine good but the Club World cabin is very cramped with very little space to put anything. I don't mind the back and front seating (I could look at my wife!) but the seat is narrow and not the most comfortable for sleeping. Very good attentive crew. Wide variety of films/music on IFE. On return the third party Lounge (Club at ATL) is much better than the Delta one. Full flight very similar to outbound but slightly early arrival at LHR was negated by the domestic flight being delayed by 90 minutes due to runway problems.,,
3112,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,yes,LGW-SZG in business class. Not sure what the point is with the new reduced legroom Club Europe seats. OK breakfast but was able to get breakfast in the lounge beforehand anyway. Only reason for going CE was because only £30 more than flexible economy ticket. If there was a big difference I wouldn't bother. Flight was on time.,,
3115,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,yes,Heathrow to Istanbul flight BA0676 in club class. I should have guessed what I was going to get when I saw this service is operated on a Boeing 767. Business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy. No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion. On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 BA has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.,,
3120,False,,,,,1.0,1,no,I travelled from London to Jo'burg and back on the Airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. On the way out I was in Premium Economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. The return in Business was a different matter. I was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passenger's feet to vacate my seat. All this at a premium price. Shocking. The cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers' views on the cabin! Never again.,,
3136,False,,India,,,2.0,4,no,DEL-LHR-HAM in Business. The club world product feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to Air India which has modern flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. Old planes old crew old seats old IFE BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.,,
3138,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,"I have been a longstanding BA gold card holder and frequent business traveller. BA has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 6'4"" I could not sit without great discomfort. This shows complete contempt for BA's customers. I first encountered this on a round trip to Brussels. It will be Eurostar for me in the future and Air France for which I also gave a gold card on other short hauls. Is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than Easyjet offers?",,
3149,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,no,"I have to admit to not being a fan of the BA Club World (Business Class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. Seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. On my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. On my flight from MLE to LGW 10 hrs 35 minutes I was in 11B facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10B. The passenger in 10A facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. It is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in Male and so after take off I was looking forward to a cold lager. The drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. The FA said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. I cannot drink warm lager and I am not a spirit drinker and so went without. I settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. No entertainment system and I then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. There were 2 meal services on the flight. The first one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad. Not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at LGW all the economy bags came off first and the Club bags with ""priority"" tags attached came off last. I have been in correspondence with BA and Customer Relations has stated ""You traveled in the cabin you originally booked. However the meals we serve and our in-flight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. The BA website has a description of this service which includes: 1) Extensive Flight Entertainment System. 2) Seat Converts to 4 key positions. 3) Choice of light meal or four course dining. BA claimed to be ""The Worlds Favorite Airline"". They are not mine. They also clam ""To Fly To Serve"". Well as they say they did fly me from MLE to LGW bt I am not quite sure where the service came in.",,
3155,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,London to Budapest and back in Club class. First leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. Usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. The return was terrible. BA do not pay for Cub Europe travellers to use Fast Track at security - disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. The lounge is mediocre at best. Absolutely not worth paying for Club. BA need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.,,
3160,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,First time in reduced leg room Club Europe. Don't bother no different to economy both colleague and I sat with legs splayed jammed into seat in front. Save your money fly in the back and spend considerable savings on a better hotel better holiday or whatever. Good crew and food though.,,
3167,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"LHR-Washington in Club World. My disappointment continues with BA on the A380 Club World seat. In theory being the flagship plane - it should have the flagship Business class seat. As a regular traveller with BA I know the ""Club"" product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. What BA risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom WILL notice and take offence and fly with someone else. Its a bit like the BA First product this used to have caviar on the JFK route and silver plated cutlery and Krug champagne. Now they don't. I notice because I used to experience it. Meanwhile prices have shot up - and quality has shot downwards. Very disappointing.",,
3171,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,no,British Airways general onboard services in First are generally acceptable. However the airline refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should be added for paid First class passengers. Ground services such as special assistance for transfers that are so widely available on other carriers for their First class passengers are sorely lacking at BA (ex. Lufthansa First Class terminal and transfers at FRA and others). Even as a Gold Executive Club top tier member there is nothing available - even when I call and request assistance on long-haul First flights (ex. LHR to HKG) that involve changes in planes between T3 and T5 at LHR. BA needs to wake up and examine the overall First product. The upgrades to the First cabin are also marginal. Packing 14 narrow (even on new A380s) seats in First puts the airline at a huge disadvantage to other OneWorld carriers who have a true First product (ex. Cathay has 8 true suites in First). Wake up BA - your premium fare paying customers are irate over this lack of First product amenities including full ground support (especially upon special request) for paying First passengers.,,
3181,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,no,"LHR-JFK. End of a One-World RTW trip. What a disappointment. After a mind-numbing trip through Flight Connections (BA to BA) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the B concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride i was escorted to the F/C cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. The seat reclines in one motion so you can't ""fine tune"" it like with other airlines. Menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good desserts and wines OK. EVOD was not to the standards of the competition. Fewer movies and TV selections than either AA or CX. Crew was fine. Stick with AA/CX from now on.",,
3193,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,yes,Out from LHR to JNB on 14th Jan flight BA55 check in poor as we were e-tickets had nothing but passports and destination never had a problem before but was more like a quiz at a pub. Also advised that we would have to pick up our luggage at JNB and check in again at JNB for MUB so we wasted time looking for luggage which was being transferred. We have never liked the premium economy seats on BA but connections in JNB made it necessary to travel BA. Seats have plenty of knee room and general space is good but are far to hard after a couple of hours my backside begins to suffer. Crew were good. As far as airline food goes it was reasonable. Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you. When possible will always try to use Virgin Atlantic.,,
3198,False,,United States,,,2.0,1,no,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of.",,
3200,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,3,no,"LHR-Zurich. The trip got off to a good start as the North lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test - which it is when it is busy. Had a nice early light lunch. The aircraft was a new A321. I like this plane. It was rammed end to end. The plane had the new Club Europe seats and it reminded me how well BA seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. As with the old C.E. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. Quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits BA they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. This was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide C.E. seat. At the same time justify the higher pricing. Its no wonder BA have very few - if any - Travel Industry awards in the services they provide. So frustrating. I had another light lunch and a couple of Gin and Tonics which was nice. The FAs were great. Flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to Zurich in 80 minutes which was great. The World's favourite airline? Try ""The Worlds most frustrating airline!""",,

New tasting menu was very good. Had a flight in business with CX a few days later and the food quality crew and overall service was another league - far outshone BA.

3227,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,yes,Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas Day returning January 5th. I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,,
3236,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,yes,LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to fly on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.,,
3249,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,LGW-MLA. For some crazy reason I still fly British Airways and pay for Club Europe. Following this trip I have come to my senses. Apart from a Berlin trip already paid for in May they can say goodbye to my business travel. This was an Airbus 320 previously owned by BMI. It was not difficult to work that out as it was still showing the BMI banner inside. The plane was never used for business. All the seats were a miserable 30 inch pitch. There was not even a curtain dividing club and economy. Just how BA think they are going to get away with this type of robbery for much longer I don't know. Unless there is an alternative carrier offering proper club facilities then its low cost airlines for me around Europe.,,
3266,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,"LHR-SFO-LHR. Why do I keep thinking BA will improve? The 747 on this route is falling to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom! Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE systems the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""! Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. Then empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. Both of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and San Fran in December decided no more. They have just got too bad.",,
3274,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,LGW to TFS in Club Europe. Disappointing that BA has downgraded its CE service to such an extent that it is not really worth paying the extra for short haul. Too little leg room now such that new seats are no different from Economy - yes the middle seat is not occupied but what both my partner and I would like is additional leg room. Not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. New seats are uncomfortable as well. Lunch service reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too. Cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin - CE clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer? Can no longer recommend BA for a four hour short-haul although good time-keeping. Such a shame that BA has allowed this to happen. Think again BA.,,
3276,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,no,"Travelled Club from MIA to LHR last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare AA flight (which was excellent!) We paid an extra £170 to pre-book seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. It's been several years since I last tried BA Club on a transatlantic flight and I was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. Compared to the Emirates business class I'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before BA are fast becoming the 'Lada' of the Airline business. The seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But worst of all the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! My wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the Cabin Crew first offered her one then said ""Oh sorry of course you're vegetarian!"" and that was it - no alternative! Never again BA!",,
3278,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,HAM-LHR Club Europe Seat 2F new cabin. Dear oh dear - surely no one within BA could have said this seat as adequate for people paying a premium. I find the new seat absolutely horrible. It's very tight and I am unable to use my laptop. Flying BA Club Europe is no longer justifiable because its no longer possible to work during the flight. Yes the luggage rack moved to eye level. It does not give the 4 inches or so lost by moving the seats closer together. Seats are also very hard and extremely uncomfortable. Dear BA - please reconsider this terrible new seat an attractive cabin alone does not make for a business class that is useful to business people.,,
3283,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"Washington - LHR. We arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new BA Executive lounge. It is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. Plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. The food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. No complaints so far. We were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the A380. Seats 50A and 50B. I was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. I hope this weird seating design is changed in the near future. It was the so called latest Club World seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. In fact the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. It has been some time since I have flown Club - the last being on a 777 to Antigua in 2010. I am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. We pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed I well put it this way tried to get some sleep. It was a horrendous experience. In 35 years of aviation travel I have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! I simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. The temperature was fine. Noise level was minimal. The ""bed"" was rock hard. To narrow. To short. The seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. I arrived into LHR without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. I had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 Club product - and back then I was 20 kilos heavier. This product is not cheap (On some sectors its as high as £7000 return) - although we purchased our tickets on Avios - with a 1st Class outbound and Club return. The saving grace was a strong tail wind that shot us across the pond in 6.5 hours. I couldn't wait to get off.",,
3285,False,,United States,,,2.0,3,no,SAN-MUC for a conference. I hold Oneworld Sapphire status yet the BA website didn't recognize and wanted to charge me for advanced seat assignments. After several phone calls with no solution BA finally called American Airlines to verify my status and assigned my seats in advance. Check in at SAN was cramped and disorganized. No offer to upgrade to the next class of service (biz class was only 1/4 full). Lounge was amazing! Boarded the 777-200 3 class service. The plane was outdated. No outlets to charge iPhone/iPad. PVOD screen was slightly bigger than an iPhone 6 screen. PVOD control on the inside of the seat. One slight move and the volume or channel changed. Very frustrating. The cabin crew clearly couldn't care less about the passengers. Meal service wasn't started until 2 hours after take off - very slow. Seats were hard and chipped and broken. I'll never fly the SAN-LHR route again with this equipment. I had better expectations. Turkish and ANZ premium economy are significantly better. However I switched back to Oneworld and don't have many choices. BA needs to up their game if they expect to remain competitive in the global world. AA is even better in economy.,,
3290,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,no,The TV is the worst I have ever experienced and I mean of all TVs ever not just airline TVs! The contrast was non-existent and the resolution appalling. It was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see (when the cabin lights were off when they were on it was impossible to see!) It wasn't just my seat my colleagues was the same and I could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of TVs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. The tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. The table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. Power sockets on a flight originating in the UK and run by a UK airline should be UK sockets not US sockets! The food was adequate but nothing special I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this! Furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid! It had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! Finally when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any. All in all this isn't the level of service that I expect when paying nearly £3000 for a flight. It was my first time flying Club with BA and I had expected a level of service equivalent to business class with other airlines how wrong I was!,,
3297,False,,United States,,,1.0,3,no,LHR to MIA on 12/8/2014. Pros: Lighting window blinds large TV personal storage PJs and food. Cons: Seat does not conform to lounge chair without activation of sleeper section. No bedding provided except used throw pillow from last seating. Four middle seats crowd the area too much. Bathroom very small. Cabin was very very dirty. Advise fly AA 777 or 77W on same route.,,
3310,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,no,"We flew ""Business/1st class"" from London to Dublin and then Berlin to London recently on an Airbus A-130 (like a 737). Three seats on a side. The only thing different from coach was they put a tray table over the center seat. The seats were as cramped as Southwest airlines. The service was excellent but the seats made it a bad deal.",,
3311,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,yes,LHR-HEL Club Europe / HEL-LHR Economy. Club has improved a lot. Great service from staff. Greeting you by your name. However the food was just cold cuts and salad - dessert thin slices of fruit. The new seats are not very comfortable but I sat in the first row so had ample leg room. Not sure if worth a full fare but as a part miles ticket it was enjoyable. The return in economy was fine. Again the new seats are not comfortable - much prefer the old ones although the cabin does look very nice. In economy you were served a sandwich and drinks including beer. I fly the same route regularly in Finnair and BA is a superior service. The flight attendants did a good job. Not overly friendly but quite attentive. The lounge at LHR terminal 3 is ok but breakfast was pretty bad. Egg muffins with no taste at all - do recommend Club Europe but only when not paying top fare.,,
3316,False,,United States,,,1.0,2,no,Phoenix to London - outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. The problem we had started on our return flight home. We boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. After being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. I was attempting to work but when I went to plug in my laptop battery I found that there was no adapter for me to use. Since I could no longer work I decided to put a movie on. The tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. The flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and I give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. I decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. You can imagine my surprise when I saw him sitting in business class with a TV screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. At this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. It doesn't make sense to me. Just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in Phoenix to face another issue. We waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in London. We've flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. The difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn't made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home. Well this time nobody informed us so we stood there waiting for 45 minutes at the baggage claim before we were told.,,
3338,False,,Canada,,,1.0,2,no,Check-in in Toronto was OK no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate. On the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time.,,
3344,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,yes,"First time with BA (a code share flight for JAL). Travelled NRT-LHR and return (BA5/BA6) on B777 in CW. Seats are designed in an S shape. This means that half the passengers fly backwards! Seats lie flat but a foot rest has to released from the wall to put your feet/legs on. Width of seats is poor and I found the seating cramped. Service was excellent both ways food good with plenty of drinks and snacks on offer. Very hard to get to storage bin to put your stuff into. One small gripe a 12 hour flight needs more than one meal and a light ""breakfast"". Lounge in Narita good standard but in Heathrow very basic.",,
3346,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,LHR-MAD Club Europe A320 Seat 2A 15.25 hrs departure: Newly refurbished cabin looked very classy in dark brown leather. Crew was excellent was start to finish. However those new seats are a catastrophe. There is not enough leg room they hardly recline and it's not possible work on a laptop. That's in Business Class. It is just like Easyjet seating but with a business fare price tag. Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. Really? The flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time. Wouldn't a light dinner be more appropriate? Terrible disappointing experience. These new seats have to go and food must improve.,,
3359,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!,,
3365,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,no,Worst experience from Bangalore to Heathrow - delayed and connecting flight from LHR to San Diego was missed. They put us on a flight to Chicago with seats in the middle of Premium Economy. We had booked bassinet seats on our missed flight. Chicago to San Diego on United - seats were not together. Overall a pathetic experience. Would never travel with BA.,,
3374,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,4,yes,Flew LGW-ACE-LHR. Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge. I find that the BA lounge at Gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast pastries and condiments! The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice. All in all BA offer a good Club Europe service they are trying to cut back and this often shows they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of Easyjet or Ryanair.,,
3377,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,no,LGW to Cancun - flew with BA in CW. The galleries lounge at Gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings! Priority boarding was announced for those travelling in CW unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. The crew were friendly and offered a good service. BA's club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. The so called CW pantry is laughable soggy inedible wraps pasta served in plastic containers crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. The inflight meal was adequate but not memorable the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into it's presentation the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. The return flight was awful the crew were miserable and clearly didn't want to be there. One member of the crew was very rude to an elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the seat and dared to ask for help. The meal just awful dry bland and totally inedible. The breakfast served prior to landing at Gatwick consisted of a bacon roll which was vile the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. Very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew.,,
3378,False,,Belgium,,,2.0,3,no,BRU-Toronto-BRU 1st class. In BRU check in passport control (very long queues) security fast track and lounge just fine but nothing very special. Security in T5 with extra long queues and very little fast track. Almost none. Lounge in T5 a bliss in all respects. Boarding ok although gate in T5b miles away. Flight itself a disaster old tatty B747 in need of an urgent revamp. Very used and ran down seats. Cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. Ran out of champagne. Food not good at all. Inflight entertainment and videos a bore with very old titles. Bags not first out. Return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took in case food was same disaster as flight in. Not full cabin this time so a little better service although quality is still zero. Again London T5 lounge a breeze and fast and short flight to BRU.,,
3382,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,Flight LGW to TFS in Business. Like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. Seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour short-haul narrower and with materially less leg-room than before the same as economy. Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. One wants to like and use BA but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. Unusually in my experience one of the FAs was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too.,,
3405,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,Travelled to Palma in new BA 'sardine' business class. Uncomfortable seats with Ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. Poor service. Despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later causing misery. Other passengers also shocked at conditions. If this is the new look business class BA then better off with Easyjet or Ryanair much cheaper and service could not be much worse.,,
3408,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"BA176 JFK to Heathrow 13 October 2014. The outward flight had been so awful so the return surely could not be any worse. How wrong I was. Arrived at business check-in at JFK terminal 7. No staff at desk. Boarding pass printed at machine but had to wait nearly twenty minutes to check luggage. Agent was rude and unhelpful. Onto the BA lounge. Sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps. On asking the receptionist where the food was I was told passengers normally use the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" facility. Asked when this opened and was told it was not operating. Eventually some badly cut sandwiches and lumps of cheese with crackers appeared. No hot food was available. Two hours before departure the flight was posted as four minutes late. No further information was posted. When I asked for an update thirty minutes before scheduled take-off I was told there would be an announcement shortly. Eventually a barely audible announcement came that the plane was now boarding. The departures board had not been updated so premium passengers were forced to shuffle along with those in the main cabin. Onboard after presenting my boarding pass I was given a grunted down there with no indication as to which side of the plane I was seated. On reflection late boarding may have been a blessing. I lost count of the times I was knocked by oversized and heavy hand luggage. Eventually the safety demonstration was played on the IFE system. The sound was inaudible. Surely a safety hazard. Similarly all announcements from the cockpit went unheard. We took off one hour and fifteen minutes late with no explanation given for the delay. The wine selection was very limited on the flight as was the menu two choices of main course and only one dessert - I asked if I could have the advertised ice cream snack for desert to be told there was none on board. Food was barely edible. Service was poor. The cabin crew seemed intent on throwing trays round as fast as possible. My salad was served with desert (which I did not want) on the tray. The main course was overcooked beef near raw vegetables. I was made to feel a nuisance when I asked for a second glass of wine. The narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed. Other carriers provide mattresses and duvets. BA seem to think a tacky blanket will do. The whole service has been downgraded to the standards I would expect in economy class. The nicieties that used to mark business flights have been lost in the pursuit of profit. Given that BA charge far more that their competitors for this route I was thoroughly disappointed. I will not use any BA flight again if there is an alternative available.",,
3414,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,BA213 Heathrow to Boston 29/09/14 B747. There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.,,
3419,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,yes,"Aberdeen-Heathrow-Miami and return World Traveller Plus (premium economy). Received a text from BA at 0600 that our 09:30 ABZ-LHR flight had been cancelled which would impact upon the US flight. Phoned the helpline as suggested. Utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday. Made unsuitable suggestions including can you get to Aberdeen for the 7:30 flight (it was 7am and had now spent 1hr on phone to them). Gave up and just went to the airport. Fortunately BA staff there were excellent and got me on next flight to Heathrow despite breaching their own min of 1 hour requirement for connections. Flight to London was good with good service leather seats. Cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and BA staff member met us to get us to next gate ASAP for Miami flight. Service centre useless but face to face staff great. LHR-MIA flight. Aircraft a 747 was old and tatty and WT+ seats were rubbish in comparison to Virgin product that I have experienced. Not that comfortable. Seat back TV is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy. Food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. Staff were pretty good. Aircraft on time. Return journey much the same but staff were better. Conclusion is that face to face staff great food great. But needs a modern fleet - our 747 was really aged and their world traveller plus product needs work with hindsight probably would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more. If you take a iPad to watch movies and are not tall economy would do the job. Their helpline needs to be addressed. Clue being in the title - HELPline. Would fly BA again but would think about their WT+ option carefully.",,
3433,False,,Spain,,,1.0,1,no,BA038 PEK to LHR 28-09-14 Business Class B747-400. First time I have flown BA long haul and in view of the many unhappy travellers on this site - I was keen to see for myself. I can honestly say I have never experienced such a dreadful flight. Antiquated and filthy plane is an experience I would never want to make again. The seating in Business class downstairs is a disgrace I was unlucky enough to have the aisle seat 17G which turned in to a flat bed so narrow my body and I am small was over the main aisle when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed. Absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing and waiting the kitchen area could see my every move. Completely unacceptable. No mattress and only a small blanket. There is nowhere to put even a pair of glasses or a bottle of water once the tray table was put up (necessary to sleep). To get to the centre seats where my husband was - a dirty plastic ‘window’ had to be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space (what there was of it.) My husband said the middle seats trapped passengers in and getting out involved stepping over people. Extremely difficult for short people. The whole design of the business class seats is very uncomfortable and seriously flawed. The food was badly presented and unappetising. The PA system from the flight deck was inaudible I could not hear the Captain in the pre flight information announcement The other issue was a very mediocre in flight entertainment system which took an hour to get going and even the flight tracking information was not available for the whole flight. They weren’t overly concerned just superficial apologies. The toilets were filthy and grimy. The floor edges and all around the basin area where bits were falling off were thick with dirty grease. I looked into the galley and that too including the floors and edges of preparation benches was full of grime. Total disgrace. The Cabin Crew seemed in a state of disorganised chaos having a great view of seeing it all from my seat. Very little contact with passengers other than rather arrogant looks all round. Needless to say I will never travel BA long haul again. They need to get on to an Emirates Airline and see how it should be done. As a regular long-haul traveller on Emirates the difference between these companies is indisputable. Perhaps the so-called ‘loyal’ BA customers have never been on a Emirates flight to compare the difference.,,
3441,False,,United States,,,2.0,2,no,Just took British from London to Seattle. Tired airplane. Flew business class. Very basic service. No wifi. Nobody checking to see if you were interested in something to drink. Basic packaged food. Very disappointed.,,
3450,False,,Canada,,,1.0,1,no,Flew from IST to LHR on September 29. In short an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly 4 hours. It started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and low-quality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gates. I have used the Star Alliance lounge at Ataturk Airport and it is light years ahead of the BA lounge. The plane was an ancient B767. The business class seats had little leg room or recline were packed out hard and very uncomfortable. It took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts. This was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began. There were only two choices nothing vegetarian. The crew were disengaged disinterested and dismissive. The entertainment system consisted of only several old screens suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie Godzilla which doubtless was a big hit with the 12 year olds in the audience. At the end of the flight we were given fast-track cards to speed up our passage through customs. Unfortunately only 3 of the 6 fast-track booths were open and we ended up effectively in the slow-track line. To add insult to injury this business class flight cost $200 more than that of its competitor Turkish Airlines and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the BA website. Shame on British Airways for this product.,,
3478,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,Flew Heathrow - Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from Spain.,,
3486,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,no,I have flown LHR-BKK many times with EVA Emirates Oman and Qatar. Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful. It's any Middle East airline again for me. Qatar being my preferred choice.,,
3492,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,no,Flew SYD-SIN and had a reasonably comfortable trip. Problem is I didn't see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking. Service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks and plenty of water. Everyone rather terse I thought and not helpful. Not my favourite to fly. The aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people.,,
3494,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,no,9/8/14 LHR-EWR in WC. Clean aircraft but moderate dysfunction of armrest foot stool and video screen. We find this seating configuration very uncomfortable and will avoid BA when possible. One FA spent this flight chatting w. friend to the blockage of aisle and detriment of service. Dinner was fairly horrid (beef) except for salad and cheese. Late departure and 40 min late arrival with no explanations given.,,
3497,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,Flew VIE to LHR Club Europe fantastic crew looking after the Club Europe cabin the only let down is the new revamped Club Europe Cabin. I really do not believe what BA is saying that this is what their European Passengers want! The seat pitch has now been reduced from 34 inches to 30 inches which used to be the Charter Airlines seat pitch years ago. If the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop as there is no room. I really am not able to justify paying the Club Europe Fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat I have ever say in. A number of passengers were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by BA. British Airways used to be a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fares BA really need to think seriously about the Club Europe layout they have added more seats so it is all about money & not about what their passengers really want.,,
3510,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,When will they learn. I flew BA to Dubai last Friday in business. Let me sum it up. Boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive. Can the product get any more unimaginative. The inflight entertainment was out of touch with modern media the screen so poor I couldn't see the movie and gave up. The sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that I think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is (again) horribly dirty. Coffee was spilt on all the wipeable areas around my seat. In business you expect better. It is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any means and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyers. When I can I chose a different airline.,,
3511,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,yes,Travelled LHR to Montreal 21st August 2014 and Montreal to LHR 1st September 2014. Aircraft used was a 777-200 with 4 classes. This sector does not normally offer a First service so business class passengers were spread throughout the First and Club World cabins. All flights were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg. Check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient. The lounges at Terminal 5 are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them. Food choice was limited although I did enjoy the hot soup. Seating in BA is dated and even BA's new First Class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carries such as Emirates or Qatar. Food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity. I know BA is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience. I guess there is little competition for BA on the north Atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share of routes to the Far East and Australia are diminishing.,,
3512,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,no,I'm regularly flying Perth-Hong Kong-London-Port of Spain these days. Perth to London is via Cathay Pacific business class which is excellent. Sadly I then have to swap to BA for London to Trinidad where 'Club World' is a euphemism for 'slum in the sky'. Cathay Pacific business class seats - 4 across the width of the aircraft. BA Club Slum - 8 across. If you're on a night flight that means tripping over people or being tripped over. Decor is abysmal service is average to poor. Seat and personal space design is lousy - but there's not much space to work with. Film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue 625 lines TVs of the 80s. The overall impression is a dreary coffin-like space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service. Don't do it! Fly with someone else - anyone else!,,
3516,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,no,"London to Budapest on Club World-now I don't even mention the fact that my luggage hasn't arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off! You can sit in the new ""slimline"" type of seat-which is thinner than the previous ones and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seats why not squeeze in another 2 extra rows which means that the leg space is less than half as it was in the old days - so exactly like in economy class. So you pay 300 dollars more for 3 stale finger sandwich and a scone - what a bargain! Shame on you BA for the lousy service. Will never fly with them again.",,
3518,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,no,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going via Dubai on Emirates in future.",,
3524,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"I have flown twice with BA now in business class (to and from Delhi) and I have to say it has been absolutely poor! Me and a few colleagues flew out to New Delhi for a business trip. BA were the pioneers of aircraft's after all they did create The Concorde. Key word in that is ""were"" they've basically turned into a no frills airline. Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape! The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special. Normally its the little things that make the differences but with BA they need a total make over. For a flight that happens everyday from London to Delhi BA should be doing more. The decor of the plane matched the experience I got with BA dull. I won't be flying long haul with them again. My advice - avoid BA and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you.",,
3533,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,no,I flew from London to Sydney Club World / Business Class. Having done similar OZ flights recently with Qatar Airlines the experience was like comparing the Premium to Third Division football clubs. Everything about BA was shoddy shabby and second rate - so sad. Numerous examples from the Business Lounge the lay out of the cabin the comfort of the seats privacy food service - all second rate. And for about £2 K extra flight cost. Why? I would seriously consider flying to Sydney via Perth next time - longer but an experience where you arrive feeling caressed not bundled along. Really pains me to say this - a very poor way to present a country's airline.,,
3542,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,no,BA 56 JNB-LHR 15 August 2014 Business class A380 upper deck. The flight did not live up to expectations. Too many seats makes business class cabin look crowded narrow seats with each row facing in opposite direction no problem with this but this impedes free movement for some of the seats specially the ones in the middle and window side also not much space for storage of personal items like specs etc. The window blinds of this section in upper deck were kept lowered through the entire 11 hr flight with no cue of any outside light whatsoever until we landed at Heathrow and parked to the stand felt like sitting in a light proof box with artificial illumination. I thought you need to keep the blinds open for landing and take off? The 747 business class is more comfortable than A380.,,
3547,False,,United States,,,2.0,2,no,We flew the A380 from LAX-LHR-JNB-LHR-LAX in August 2014 in business class. This plane was designed by someone who never flew it. The seats are so close together with no room on the window side to get out when the seats are flat. A person has to put up the foot rest for a place to stand and then step over the person next to them to get out into the aisle. In addition the person on the window seat gets all the food handed to them in front of the face of the person on the aisle. They have put so many people in each row that the seats are very narrow. There is virtually no place ( a small drawer at the seat) for personal items to be used during the flight without getting out of the seat to get something from the overhead.,,
3549,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,Sad to say BA missed a big opportunity when their new 787 and A380 entered service. Same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. Compared to many airlines the BA premium service is poor and I don't know how they keep a 4 star rating. The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess. The 787 was good and BA have improved their IFE system but screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike those in economy and premium. Pay more get less.,,
3558,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,2,no,Travelled LHR-YYZ BA97 on 9 July returning BA96 28July. Check-in at LHR an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. Galleries Lounge at the south end of T5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. Outbound aircraft was G-BNLG surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. On boarding all the window shades were down (10.20 departure) and stayed down for the entire flight including take-off and landing most peculiar. The head cabin service person said it was to keep the sun out - I have questioned if this is a new BA policy for daytime flights. Departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. Food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international Business Class elsewhere. Immigration and baggage delivery in YYZ very swift. For the return again the departure formalities were quick and painless ; the lounge at Pearson is ok but nothing special. Aircraft this time was G-BGYC the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with BA's Club World seating there is little stowage space and the whole backwards/forwards concept is something I personally dislike. Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. Unfortunately it was no better than going to McDonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. Also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. Is this service policy poor seat design or lazy crew? Flight on time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. All in all the experience was what I expect from BA these days average at best.,,
3568,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"LHR-CPH-LHR Business Class. This is a joke. Scruffy aircraft with ripped upholstery dirty cabin and chaotic/slow ""service"". I know it's a short flight (90 mins) but it shouldn't take over an hour to get one cup of cold stewed tea. Flight attendants including their ""manager"" didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing. Seats are actually narrow economy 3x3 configuration with the middle one kept vacant. Inflight entertainment? Easy there isn't any. For the price I paid this was an absolute disgrace. I seriously think I'd have a better experience with EasyJet.",,
3597,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"LGW-BGI-LGW Club World R/T. Old careworn B777-200. Airplane was not clean both sectors. Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. Inbound airplane toilets reeked. At least food on return was slightly improved. Cabin Crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. The Club World seats are narrow and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens poor and tiny selection of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. I am amazed that British Airways standards are so low and they get away with it. This is mere A to B transport. What is missing from their Business Class is ""class"".",,
3634,False,,Thailand,,,2.0,1,no,London - BKK Premium economy 19/6/14. I always travel EVA Air business but this time I had to get into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and I was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible. I must admit I didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. I was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. Drinks G&T were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. The only redeeming factors were I didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike EVA 1/2/1 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early.,,
3640,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,no,I was excited to fly on the new A380 with the new seating. We sat in 14j and 14k. When we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. This is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger. I was told I would be contacted by a representative but that did not happen.,,
3645,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,1,no,"Club Europe - supposedly premium - had the misfortune of seat 1f - normally a great seat in Club Europe - but for a 4 hour flight LGW to ACE - cramped (not quite as bad as the rest of CE with new - not advertised - 30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch) - no window just a wall. Add to this limited luggage space think its EasyJet with middle seat free for £600 more. Is it worth it - no thinking avoid BA CE offering - shame I've a few flights to suffer yet. Purser - ""this is it now - get used to it"" - service downhill too.",,
3646,False,,Canada,,,1.0,1,no,We travelled to and from Europe in business class for a two week Mediterranean cruise. We upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. My first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. The food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace). Upon our return we awaited in London Heathrow Terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. It finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite C - it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. She did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. Well I am here to tell all - don't pay the money. There is little to no difference in first class. The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen. This time I think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selection/choice. To tell you the truth if I had paid for this upgrade I would have been upset as I don't believe this is up to par. We also did a connector flight from Venice to London on the Saturday. The airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no organization from the agents and very little help. When we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. Upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. When we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. The last part is not fully BA's fault (they don't design the airports or determine airspace closure) however their agents did nothing to make it better either (by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates). All in all I don't believe I will ever fly BA again - this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard - now they are barely sweeping up the floor (wish they had - at least it may have been cleaner).,,
3649,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,1,no,I flew LHR-YVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats. I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.,,
3672,False,,United Kingdom,,,1.0,2,no,London (LHR) to Houston (IAH) to London (LHR). T5 in Heathrow is crazy We been up and down the lifts and get train to other gates. We got boarding first then people comes in the plane. When the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land. The seat was uncomfortable old and tired. The Cabin Crew were so miserable.,,
3689,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,no,Dublin to Sydney (via Heathrow and Singapore). Club Europe from Dublin to London and club world to Sydney. Flight to Heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. Upon arrival in Heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. Upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. By this time it was about 10pm. Obviously missed the connecting flight to Sydney so tried to find a BA contact in terminal 4. Was then advised to go to terminal 1. No BA reps around and no 24 hr phone number. Then transferred to terminal 5. By this time it was midnight and still no BA contacts. Finally went to baggage services and saw a BA rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. Finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by BA they provided us with the option of flying back to Sydney on BA or could see if they could get us on a China Southern flight (we had originally booked China Southern). We took the BA option as it was easiest and needed to come home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded through Gate C in terminal 5 (hate Heathrow airport). Lounge in Heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. Upon boarding the BA business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. Seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. We had the two middle seats E and F which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. Flight left on time and arrived in Singapore on time. There was a delay of an hour in Singapore but again that couldn't be helped. They were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. Good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. Seats were small and very uncomfortable. The amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. The hit towels were anything but hot. Food was below average. Overall I wouldn't recommend British Airways Club Europe/world. The best I've experienced so far from Sydney to Europe would have to be on China Southern. Considering they are 2-3 grand cheaper than British Airways and they offer a better business class product and a more seamless transfer process.,,
3697,False,,United Kingdom,,,2.0,3,yes,"Boeing 767 Club Europe to Istanbul and back. The seats were tatty and very worn leg room limited at best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not recline their seats. The head rests are hanging off as are parts of the cabin. The food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great. Even though I know they do that in the galley in first class it doesn't need to be on display. Crew much better inbound.",,
3735,False,,Australia,,,1.0,1,no,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.,,
3760,False,,United States,,,1.0,1,no,London City-New York JFK via Shannon on A318 but had really nice seats and professional crew. Meal served was very tasty and fresh. Overall a very good flight would use this airline again.,,
