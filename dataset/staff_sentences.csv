Review
Staff utterly incompetent.
As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety.
During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work.
I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit.
the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent.
Staff are courteous and professional;
with friendly staff.
During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me.
It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account.
Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived.
Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous.
"Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline,"
"Staff look tired and overworked,"
we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful.
the staff in charge should be retrained!
Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right?
The staff seemed rushed off their feet .
You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews.
but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this.
On board staff were fine.
I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages.
The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight.
understaffed and poorly equipped.
Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow).
"Staff were very good during the first few hours of service,"
the cabin and ground staff service were ok.
Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down.
Are staff given no training in customer service?
When I told the staff she just laughed at me.
The actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly - and helpful.
Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules.
they cant even look after their staff let alone customers.
very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early.
and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff.
dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope.
"There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew,"
so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year.
probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic.
the BA staff.
Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us.
"Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order,"
"No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid,"
check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day.
Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth.
The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers.
"The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents,"
I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service.
"with staff giving very different reasons for the delay,"
"was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered,"
that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked).
All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund.
"cabin staff ok,"
appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint.
and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask.
"Even the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the telephone number and email for the department who deal with this,"
The staff are very rude and not trained properly.
2) Staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance.
3) Staff were quite unpleasant.
A single BA staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart.
Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.
Why don't you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand.
No BA staff available.
Very helpful Gatwick staff got us a bus to LHR and a flight to Toulouse.
staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right.
"Staff uncommunicative,"
Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket.
"The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff,"
"Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here,"
The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine.
"Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle."
Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help.
"BA staff were virtually non-existent,"
"The staff were pleasant enough,"
Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff.
no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly.
On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers.
The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there.
Terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff.
Staff at the terminal rude.
"Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous,"
Most customers she serves have a complaint Staff don't care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.
The Staff were efficient.
the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service.
All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better.
Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor.
despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful.
The ground staff were not helpful.
I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive.
and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing.
"Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best,"
and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight.
Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays.
The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed.
Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down.
the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt.
the cabin was clean and the staff friendly.
"The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive,"
I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful.
However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious.
Denied wheelchair assistance at LHR for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot.
"Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05,"
the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat.
Horrible flight with disappointing staff.
At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least.
"Lovely staff,"
but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks.
When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30.
I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room.
"I asked the staff to call a cab,"
Staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold.
"Held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff,"
The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight.
"At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees,"
"Staff need customer training,"
"and ground staff were very warm,"
Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge.
"Very competent check in staff,"
I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA.
Communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed.
Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible.
"I did reach out to another staff ,"
"Even though staff offered vouchers,"
however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay.
Easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to BA.
Staff were great - what you got for your money not so much.
Staff were ok.
The staff are friendly.
"today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours""."
had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd.
There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times.
Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme.
but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares!
"The cabin staff were fine,"
"Friendly staff,"
The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.
but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff.
"That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line,"
"attentive staff,"
Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed.
I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me.
Staff walked down with some water and biscuits.
The staff disappeared for most of the flight.
Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed.
and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient.
Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous.
"met with nothing but rude staff,"
"Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future,"
most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called.
The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers.
Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice.
"I could see that staff did their best,"
staff were harassing me.
The staff were no help and frankly rude.
Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional.
the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test.
drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly.
"they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"","
excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff.
Staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals.
We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us.
We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others.
"When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person,"
In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers).
It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy.
British Airways is poorly staffed at Venice airport.
"We asked BA staff for refund,"
I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day.
"Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly,"
No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers.
"Staff service was perfunctory,"
"Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are ""very busy right now"" and our baggage will arrive ""soon."
under-staffed or following poor procedures.
I received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond.
"Even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at Vancouver,"
"Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US,"
Staff was attentive though and tried their best.
Staff very friendly and professional.
"Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications,"
"the staff seemed very overwhelmed,"
"Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members,"
The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight.
nothing was too much for the staff.
Good staff as ever.
I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022.
"overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac,"
Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel.
"decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers,"
"the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR,"
ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out.
50mins late due to slow gate staff.
"until they sort out their stressed ground staff,"
The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals.
"I went to complain to various BA staff,"
Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved.
"A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return,"
Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing.
We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in.
"What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor,"
The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful.
The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA.
The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers.
the staff will say there is nothing they can do.
I made staff aware.
there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight.
or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell.
No staff to serve the waiting passengers.
this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US.
staff proactive and food served quickly.
staff were friendly and efficient.
Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff.
so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff.
Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates.
While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless.
However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke.
They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker.
Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop.
Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while.
A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working.
I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!
The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.
The staff was very kind and friendly as well.
"From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff,"
Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked.
only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat.
One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in.
There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally.
Lounge staff were very nice in both directions.
"amazing staff,"
although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time).
then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather.
"BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive,"
"It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process,"
their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers.
There was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger.
Check in staff friendly but too few of them.
drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too.
"Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware,"
Staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be.
"They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff,"
The cabin staff were attentive and efficient.
where two BA staff were contradicting each other.
the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake.
the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds.
I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me.
"They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers,"
One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.
BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part.
I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out.
It was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at Heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft.
No check in staff for Economy.
The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful.
"this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don’t seem to want this,"
On board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to Ryanair.
Staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience.
"after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprised and fixed it,"
I recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff weren't interested in helping me return home.
which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment.
but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details.
Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come.
The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time.
Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it.
"Staff worked hard,"
Staff was so rude and treated us like trash.
The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice.
"cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff,"
British Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime.
Professional staff;
they had to protect staff'.
"there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response,"
My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane.
At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country.
I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion.
"While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific,"
Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful.
On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual.
I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.
All the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment.
The staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me.
Extremely rude staff and service.
Staff were friendly and helpful!
guidance or remorse from the staff.
"The staff were great,"
the Check-In-Staff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor.
"Iberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice,"
"cabin staff okay,"
"The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast,"
BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job.
I was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff!
The only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy.
The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston.
"staff very nice,"
This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough.
All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them.
The flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly.
The staff were incredibly rude and lazy.
We asked the staff if they could fix the problem.
Fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer.
We had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up.
the staff were surly and rude.
Service bad from staff.
For the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.
The staff were so friendly and I cannot even complain about the food served on board.
"your staff are amazing we will be British Airways in the future,"
Very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases.
The first thing is the shortage of staff.
the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained.
I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.
Rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 GBP.
I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at Heathrow when I lost my passport on Thursday evening -21st November.
Staff were polite.
The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do.
Cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions.
No bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered.
I have to commend BA staff on this occasion.
"The cabin staff were pleasant,"
Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff.
"Staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 J/K,"
A big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic.
"but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us,"
"At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary,"
but it seems that they were understaffed.
I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have to leave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the plane.
no staff to answer my question.
no staff to make it better.
A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude.
I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant.
Staff are very friendly and helpful.
"The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were,"
the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful.
Very stressful at least the staff were nice.
In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight.
"poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff,"
"When my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50GBP because one of the suitcases was 4cm oversize,"
"Staff said that if he did not pay,"
staff were very efficient and pleasant.
My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen.
we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so.
Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport.
We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up.
we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave.
The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us.
We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere.
Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage.
However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful.
The staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it.
This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft.
They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers.
Rude and incompetent Iberia ground staff in Malaga.
Cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor.
45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up.
It’s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers.
How does British Airways get away with having such a useless IT system and presumably team of IT staff / management?
"All the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn't turn up,"
Staff were not in high standards.
In our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft.
Very sad and staff did not care about this situation.
Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us.
Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff.
Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight.
I must state staff on plane very good.
2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start.
Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money.
but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed.
"Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front,"
I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in.
The staff is some of the worst I have had on airlines.
The cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly.
no apologies from the staff.
Poor staff spent most of the flight apologising.
BA staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins.
The airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed.
Return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed.
Staff on both flights fine.
"pleasant staff,"
"I feel very proud that British Airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard,"
"The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience,"
I arrived 3 hours before flight where I waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency.
a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking.
"2 BA staff working in two desks,"
The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff!
At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight.
and few staff to be seen.
CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once.
and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff.
"BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane,"
What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time?
the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there.
where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.
the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive.
Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training.
They seemed to be short on staff.
The staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip.
Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff.
The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort.
One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.
Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.
lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case.
Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional.
The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy.
Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand.
Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane.
exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food.
Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season.
BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed.
From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful.
"Staff have been nice when around but aircraft,"
staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley.
I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming.
Cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile.
Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.
The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted.
"Rude staff,"
I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal.
but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me.
The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up.
"The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow,"
Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to.
food a little better and staff seemed more attentive.
it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal.
The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can.

Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports.

and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).
I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.
The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful.
Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later.
In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat.
"Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that""."
"Totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff,"
My entire trip was great and I really was treated very well also on my final leg to Accra by the BA staff in London as well.

Dialed for BA baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again.
The flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience.
the staff are hit and miss - but more miss than anything and very poorly turned out.
There were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow.
Thankfully BA airline staff are always the best.
Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge.
"When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was,"
"so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that,"
staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average).

ground staff at Jeddah some of them were rude.
the staff told them to wait.
BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.
The flight was on an A320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too.
Corporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff.
When we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around.
The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt.
Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine.
They could have just got more staff there to begin with.
The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight.
The staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money.
a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off.
When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with British Airways staff.
average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with LH facilities in FRA or MUC.
The staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there.
I hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering.

I had called the British Airways customer service staff to ask about my plane change at London Heathrow from Washington Dulles to Glasgow.
The only complaint I have is about the ground staff at Heathrow.

Security screening was extremely slow and staff rude.
I was told by BA check in staff in Venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together.
The staff were clear that it is BA policy that bags cannot be fastened together.
the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in Venice.
BA has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact BA employees or employed by a third party.
"some staff were good,"
and discourteous Iberia staff.
in business I got a panini - the staff looked embarrassed to serve it.

but the ground staff are beyond it.
The staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive language.
The cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind.
meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag.
Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers.
The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.
but their staff is the best in Europe.
the gate staff announced the plane would be delayed by one hour due to a  technical fault.
"The staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 USD to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes,"

"staff,"
however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English.
Staff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain.
The worst staff I had  met.
Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this.
so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage.
We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.
I feel for the staff who often work tirelessly.

The member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation.

On this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff.
"On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage,"

Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years.
the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as I have a gold card on Oneworld.
To use the lounge I had to use my Priority Pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff.

The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle.

"Full flight and gate staff being quite keen to check passenger hand luggage,"
Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure.
Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage.
The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped.
The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers).
Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored).

If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with.
but how can an airline like British Airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes?
I saw an elderly Chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in BA uniform walked away and ignored them.

My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier.

On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do.
Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets.
I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers.

"the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do,"
The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across.
"Staff very pleasant,"
The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front.
"Staff attitude is appallimg,"
Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care.
Food was good and the staff were very nice and attentive.
and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines.
"CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child,"
Food was very good and the service staff were all very nice and attentive.
"BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive,"
The level of service from cabin staff was excellent.
Return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep.
The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there.
"Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money,"
It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum.
drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away.
BA staff were excellent from the start to the finish.
"Ground and cabin staff were friendly,"
It was our tenth wedding anniversary not one member of staff said anything (I spoke with back duty office the day before and was told they would arrange a glass of champagne inflight).
where it broke - the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps?
Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems.
"Staff returned ashen faced,"
staff disappeared.
"and cabin staff attentive,"
I was impressed with the cheerful nature of cabin staff.
"BA staff also do let things down a bit,"
and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here.
"I flew out on the 8th June 2015 and all I can say is that the staff,"
"Staff are professional,"
Ordered champagne delivered promptly but it was difficult to get a refill as staff a bit overwhelmed so fixed own G&t.
On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants.
The BA cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in Business or First as second-class citizens and barely do their job.
Staff interrupt each other and discuss their own business in priority to completing the check in.
Travelled from Venice to Gatwick on 28th May check in staff rude and unhelpful plane seats and food trays dirty and seats very worn and uncomfortable.
Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff.
It seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum.
The meal was fine for economy class and the staff were polite and attentive.
"On mentioning it to the cabin staff all she got was ""their cutting down"" in all areas."
Staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.
BA staff at Heathrow told us the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage (causing big issues) the plane was overly hot on both legs of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flights this is a known problem on these older planes.
"The staff seemed surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one stewardess near us at the rear of the plane refused two requests from passengers to bring water using the defence that she was ""on my own back here and cannot leave my post""."
Yes we departed 2 hours and 21 minutes late and still without explanation or apology of any kind from any of the staff!
Staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing you a favour.
Fantastic service and attentive staff.
The Fast Track security staff were disorganised and patronising.
The Mixed Fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service.
The service on board was excellent friendly staff both ways provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuits and a chocolate mousse both ways return not as nice as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks.
YYZ-LHR-BRU: First - Club World: Check-in in Toronto was smooth with very nice and friendly ground staff.
When boarding friendly cabin staff was waiting and I was escorted to my seat.
Cabin crew and cabin staff director introduced themselves personally to each passenger in First Class.
Staff on board were polite and efficient.
Ground staff were very cheerful and friendly.
The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum.
This time again check-in was smooth with friendly ground staff the best croissant in this lounge.
WTP so the food was OK the thing is during the trip the LAX sector had reverted back to the legacy staff.
The staff tried until around half way through the flight when a woman who spoke with a brogue I guess Eire arrived to take charge and declared the bar closed.
So to sum up most BA staff really do try to make passengers (the customers) enjoy the experience;
On all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful.
All in all four excellent flights - BA seem to have improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience).
I really cannot fault any aspect of the journey from the check in staff to the cabin crew and seat comfort.
A warm welcome greeted by name and escorted to my seat by a smiling member of staff.
Bed was made by staff with extra mattress provided.
Staff brilliant always smiling and discretely present to serve.
Greeted by name and offered a glass of champagne by a charming member of staff.
The bed was made by the staff using an extra mattress.
Had lunch in the lounge and think our host was just finishing her shift as not that attentive and service improved markedly when other staff took over after our starters.
Overall staff very good although one member of staff forget to give bread rolls out with the dinner until asked.
The same member of staff also forgot requested drinks.
There was a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
Staff were friendly and helpful aircraft was clean and IFE gave a wide choice.
The flight was ok and punctual B777 not really my choice as very noisy staff service - one hostess was excellent another was ignorant and unwilling.
Cabin crew were very friendly and efficient as were the airport staff.
Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors.
So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate.
The check in staff were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg of my trip I also met others on the same flight where this was allowed.
Cabin on both planes was clean staff mostly attentive (Hong Kong leg to Heathrow staff were worst of the 4 legs - ok but didn't seem overly interested in going the extra mile).
I had veggie meals which were generally tasty and as usual served prior to everyone else - i did have to remind staff on the last leg to offer me a drink when they served everyone else's meal.
We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all.
Trip made even better by an upgrade to PE on return journey staff found out my partner and I got engaged couldn't have been nicer.
Everything great apart from the final leg to DUB Gatwick didn't send our bags (even though we had a 6 hour layover) then preceded to keep us hanging in DUB for another 5 hours on the promise that they were on the next flight and the next ground staff of Aer Lingus were great too would fly all again.
I travel a lot for work and always try to fly BA whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a Gold card So for our annual vacation I was looking forward to hopefully getting us all (wife plus 9 year old daughter) into the First Class lounge at LHR as a nice start to our holidays sadly the staff member on the door said no.
So I asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively 'that is not protocol'.
Score given here reflect the good service in the air (would give almost full marks if not for the ground staff behaviour).
Probably the most worrying thing besides the extremely poor English by cabin and flight crew was the cabin staff apparent indifference to seats being up right for landing preventing some passengers taking their over head luggage down while in the air and on landing passengers up and around while the aircraft was moving.
very clean and the staff were attentive.
On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 BA has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.
The cabin staff were helpful and friendly.
This time travelling on 30/03/15 LCA-LGW the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers.
The staff did not offer any hot drinks and when I walked all the way to the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if I wanted one I could go and get it from service area.
The staff couldn't have looked any more disinterested in their passengers!
Whilst the flight continued to board for another 15 minutes I spent arguing with BA staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight.
First class lounge staff refused to call the gate.
Staff in addition took calls whilst handling my - urgent - request further delaying the process.
Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us.
Lounges good and lounge staff friendly both LHR and PHL.
Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me.
On time in both directions staff were professional and polite.
To begin with when I reached Mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage.
There was a minor system glitch at Punta Cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed.
Cabin staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight.
Staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble.
Ground staff of no use whatsoever.
Staff totally unhelpful.
The divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness.
The cabin staff were co-operative in allowing me to use one of their seats in order to stretch my legs but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence.
Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor.
As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked.
The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc.
All the staff was nice and accommodating.
Travelled with an elderly passenger attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights.
Cabin staff were attentive and helpful flight was on time cabin spotless food excellent seats comfortable.
We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.
LGW-ACF-LGW (Club Europe) On both flights we had very good cabin staff infact the purser was the same on both flights and he was very efficient and very friendly as were both stewardesses.
First flight to LHR was great with an informative Captain and friendly efficient staff on a refurbished A320.
has got to rank as one of the worst airlines to travel with staff with generally poor and indifferent attitudes penny pinching which is bordering on mean and poor legroom.
Staff ok.
The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed.
We were celebrating my wife's birthday on the way out and the staff were outstanding.
Return (overnight) flight also very good - efficient staff and seats comfortable enough to get some sleep.
Minimal staff meant it took three plus hours to get checked in to a hotel.
Then trying to arrange the return minimising waiting time for the little one took 5 hours with two staff serving 400 passengers with no concern for customers.
5 hrs until staff arrived.
Flight departed on time we were received well by staff at check-in and had no problems leaving MEX.
Service was very good staff were attentive whilst not overwhelming which is important on a night flight: we were not disturbed but knew refreshments could be brought when requested.
Overall good service and communicative staff dated aircraft and equipment.
When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes.
Seats were ok actually moderately comfortable for economy staff better than they used to be.
That transfer hall should be massive and full of staff rather than anxious travellers fretting about missing their connection.
I have travelled many times with BA and always found the staff very attentive but sadly not on this occasion.
The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances.
The staff at LHR are rude jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort.
"BA brought a whole new meaning to ""cattle class"" The cabin staff were efficient and professional the food was fine."
Very satisfied with service staff friendly and professional.
One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself.
Plane clean and tidy excellent in flight entertainment good food and drink served by friendly staff.
The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first.
On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one.
Lovely newish plane and very attentive staff with smiles.
However it took the staff at least 5 minutes to collect our coats.
Loud tired staff not really interested just working on automatic.
Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way.
On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated.
As long as BA doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the A380.
Staff service was good but still lots of room for improvement.
"Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""!"
For those looking to fly BA the lounges aircraft and staff are good to go but the food needs to be improved.
Nice friendly staff too.
Staff service on the whole was reasonable however they did very little other than the main meal services also the head FA was particularly unfriendly bordering on rude.
Nice friendly staff too.
Staff service on the whole was reasonable however they did very little other than the main meal services also the head FA was particularly unfriendly bordering on rude.
The quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception.
Old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service.
The staff all agree that this was pathetic!
Great service from staff.
Staff on this flight were quite poor forgot to serve me dinner and disregarded the call button literally had to physically stop the steward in the aisle to get service.
Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant.
Boarding in UK and Toronto was smooth and helpful ground staff were always visible and proactive in offering and helping passengers.
Security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them.
The seats were leather and comfortable staff polite beautiful service.
Only 3 staff serving 200 people.
Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night.
Obviously in Club World staff have more time to spend with passengers.
Cabin service in general good with fairly attentive staff.
Economy yes but rude staff poor food and uncomfortable seats.
AMS-LHR-JNBJNB-LHR-AMS all flights on time very clean and new aircraft staff very friendly and nice food.
On the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed.
Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better.
I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.
It was in such poor shape and the staff were hopeless.
Arrival at LAX improved and staff were very pro active in splitting ESTA and non and passengers and getting people through as quickly as possible.
I needed to call my workplace to arrange work cover but the cabin staff said there was no BA phone I could use.
Passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little direction on what to do.
We were eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel staff were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms - families were separated.
Staff at Muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife (who is a wheelchair user).
On arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user (despite having assistance booked in advance) which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered.
We flew out on Oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff.
Staff very efficient friendly and smiling - willing to assist during the entire overnight flight.
Despite a delay due to traffic at LHR and later around ZRH the staff handled everything well and were still very warm and welcoming.
Plenty of drinks rounds during the flight and staff very pleasant polite and helpful.
If you want to pay thousands for a worn out badly designed seat to be insulted by crew who will go out of there way not to serve you book BA otherwise do yourself a favour and go with an airline that doesn't employ over unionised staff that take pleasure in being rude to passengers.
Lovely lounge at TXL small but more than made up for by the local staff in the lounge.
Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge.
Check in staff in Tampa told us we had no seats despite having printed boarding passes!
Staff openly ate the left over food from Business Class in the rear galley.
Inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible- no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight.
Bag drop was fast gate was peaceful boarding on time and orderly all staff very pleasant refreshments good and landed on time.
The staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size (can't blame them).
The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better.
Attentive cabin staff who made sure I was comfortable.
Staff started serving meals all of a sudden went by about 7 or 8 rows of us and forgot to come back to feed us.
On board service was very good staff were great food was good.
Again staff and service were top notch.
Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help.
When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job.
When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help.
In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats.
The Menzies ground staff are doing their best but does not have any authority to help when things go wrong.
One sometimes miss the old well trained BA staff.
No staff at desk.
Utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday.
Fortunately BA staff there were excellent and got me on next flight to Heathrow despite breaching their own min of 1 hour requirement for connections.
Cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and BA staff member met us to get us to next gate ASAP for Miami flight.
Service centre useless but face to face staff great.
Staff were pretty good.
Return journey much the same but staff were better.
Conclusion is that face to face staff great food great.
Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control.
Full flight both ways quite unhappy staff on return leg tiny seatback screens and poor selection of entertainment meals satisfactory (taste was ok and enough to fill me up both legs on time but was quite expensive for the service I got.
The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat.
When I got to Gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance.
Lounge: Flagship lounge (Concorde Room) is quiet elegant reasonably well staffed and conveniently located after security.
When I checked in at Changi the check-in staff member told me the incoming flight from London was overbooked and I was downgraded to economy (against my wishes obviously).
Without being completely detrimental to BA I Have found the airline has become tired and lacking in Customer Service from the Cabin Crew as I fly economy class at Company expense this class of traveler is viewed by the cabin staff as something to be tolerated until the end of the flight.
Check in/bag drop at T5 once again very slow appears to be a staff shortage at some times of the day.
Unfortunately we were seated in economy so space was very tight but the staff could not have been anymore accommodating which greatly helped.
Flights were on time both ways food was reasonably good & cabin staff were charming (specially on the outboard flight).
Although the food was quite limited I really liked the entertainment and the staff service.
While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different.
Staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the CPT leg.
LAX was a joy to use in comparison - so smooth and staff extremely pleasant and helpful despite having a poor reputation.
Staff were indifferent and inattentive.
Very attentive staff on the B767.
The staff were extremely friendly and attentive with high quality food and excellent champagnes and wines.
Staff attentive and pleasant.
Staff attentive and professional.
We asked a BA member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her!
Upstairs on the 747 in Club was excellent professional attentive staff good food and wine good entertainment BA at its best the only flaw was no menu cards because of a mistake at JFK no surprise.
As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table.
Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean.
Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out.
He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity.
Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes.
No one from BA or BAA at the c gates to explain and when raised by BA customer service staff they were uninterested and as usual blamed BAA rather than taking responsibility.
LHR-HKG on the new A380 in premium economy and it was a great trip staff were friendly and the food was very good for a gluten free meal.
Staff on the outbound leg superb attentive without being intrusive food as ever palatable and overall great trip.
Lounge at Seattle is simply too small with insufficient seating however once on plane staff were again excellent although they appeared little rushed when compared with the outbound leg that may simply be because the CW cabin was more full.
He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity.
Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes.
Problem is I didn't see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking.
Food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food.
The plus point was the politeness and professionalism of the cabin staff.
Staff at Rome were wonderful what a contrast to Heathrow.
"When I asked for assistance three members of staff at the ""Helpdesk"" did anything but help."
The BA flight BA0209 was an old plane - the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor.
Staff were pleasant and the IFE was fine.
I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me.
Smooth ride through airport and pleasant staff on hand to help.
Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none.
Everyone who checked in online had to wait in a very long line to simply have their bags tagged and sent on their way by a member of BA staff.
We then had the situation of BA staff dragging people out of the line as they were going to miss their flight.
Even the very nice BA staff member who did our bag tags could not explain what went wrong.
No issue with boarding or the staff on board all very helpful.
None of this done by BA staff but they are doing BA's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to London.
The lounge was quite busy but the staff were very helpful.
Had a treatment - chair massage and Elemis staff were most attentive.
BA DXB Galleries Lounge reception staff member excellent.
On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights.
BA 937 was delayed for about 1 hour due to foggy weather in London so the very nice staff start to serve Drinks to reduce the waiting time on ground.
Check-in for BA 932 (bought liquids) in T5 was very quick also friendly staff.
The staff were overall very pleasant and happy to help when asked but just weren't pro-active.
The staff in Houston even found and returned my iPod which I had left on the aircraft on the outbound sector.
Despite this the staff were friendly and helpful although the food wasn't that great (the chocolate desert was delicious though).
Had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old - no luck.
Even when flying on a paid flight I find the staff snooty they have a bad customer attitude.
Told by staff member never mind just do it at the airport not much point in reporting it because they won't do anything for 24 hours.
2 staff obviously not sufficient.
We flew to Rome from Newcastle via Heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at Heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home I received a text at 17.
Then when we boarded we were delayed by another hour thankfully once on board the cabin crew and pilots were great at communicating and almost made up for the bad handling by ground staff.
Staff were very friendly and helpful with our Kids.
Staff very friendly and helpful with our kids.
The point about most BA flights these days is to expect nothing and when u get the odd staff member who actually does that extra to consider it as a bonus.
Boarding very good onto a new plane good seats good entertainment staff seemed interested and engaging.
The staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than I could've imagined for an economy route.
Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes.
Outstanding service staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable.
The staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail.
The staff were also pleasant and professional.
Staff reasonably efficient and friendly throughout the flight.
20am flight 1340 5/7 the day before due to staff issues and changed me to a 13.
Amazed such a big airline can't manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to Leeds to see the start of the 2014 TDF.
Staff were good and visited us often.
Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable.
Staff always efficient and polite.
Airport staff were helpful although I was surprised there was no lounge access at all ( we got 2x USD 22 vouchers for the restaurants in the airport).
Staff functional but not friendly only one water run in 13 hours.
No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks.
The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly.
Staff give the impression that they are above service and I did not feel that they were courteous or polite.
On one occasion I asked for a glass of champagne and never got one on another occasion when I dropped my fork for the meal and buzzed for another one no one came when I tried to grab the attention of the staff member walking past he said sorry sir I'll be right with you and never came.
Ground staff and flight attendants very professional and friendly.
Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats.
seats were comfortable staff were unfailingly attentive friendly polite and efficient.
Great staff food offering poor I would have been happy to pay for a better option.
And the on-board staff were super.
the staff seemed unconcerned at the delay no explanation or apology were offered unless they were in the inaudible announcement but I doubt it as it was quite short.
Not impressive although the staff on board were friendly and polite.
However our biggest issue was with the staff on board the flights.
I had read that British Air now has a new system where the same staff does not do the same routes on a consistent basis.
There was some kind of baggage delivery failure at check-in but the staff managed it very well smiling and being professional.
Pleasant staff and light snack on short flight.
Uninterested and incompetent staff.
The two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets.
The staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals.
All this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers.
It took me 3 hours to get a drink - the staff were cheerful they simply didn't do anything.
Transit through LHR is always an unalloyed joy and this time I had to go through immigration which added to the fun but despite this I still had time for a very quick shower between flights - hooray and full marks for the lounge staff.
The staff were well turned out and other than one cabin crew member the cabin staff were professional and polite.
The problem is staff.
Cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested.
From Sydney check in staff wonderful courteous and helpful.
Cabin crew just as wonderful as Check in Staff.
Again check in Staff were wonderful and helpful.
Staff very efficient and friendly.
The staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats.
Concorde room was lovely great staff and nice breakfast.
First class service onboard staff were very good.
No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty.
Staff friendly and a good snack and beverage included.
Trip back felt like it had been crewed by brand new staff in the cabin.
I warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me.
In conclusion I found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing.
The worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.
The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable.
Rating : 10/10 Cabin Flown Economy Value for Money Seat Comfort Staff Service Catering Entertainment Recommended
The flight staff had some really courteous people while some were pretty snobbish.
Outbound flight good with attentive staff return flight staff couldn't seem to care less had to ask for everything even water and coffee after lunch.
A very short flight with very efficient and effective staff.
At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on.
Staff more attentive both on the ground and inflight.
The only things that impress me with BA are the staff and their ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay BA so much money to be treated like cattle.
Have flown British Airways on this route many times now and they have never had a flaw in decent service and staff whether on the ground or in the skies.
It is sad to see that the bmi staff have lost all sense of pride in their jobs.
The staff were unapproachable and looked fed up.
The journey was fine staff polite in-flight entertainment excellent.
