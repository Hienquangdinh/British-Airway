2,During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me.,Understaff Problems
15,"I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped.",Understaff Problems
19,Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow).,Understaff Problems
27,Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules.,Understaff Problems
29,"Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early.",Understaff Problems
34,Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us.,Understaff Problems
36,I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service.,Understaff Problems
38,"The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund.",Understaff Problems
42,The staff are very rude and not trained properly.,Understaff Problems
45,Why don't you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand.,Understaff Problems
46,"I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right.",Understaff Problems
51,"Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly.",Understaff Problems
54,On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers.,Understaff Problems
76,"Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better.",Understaff Problems
77,The ground staff were not helpful.,Understaff Problems
81,The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed.,Understaff Problems
85,"Denied wheelchair assistance at LHR for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot. Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05, 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water. When walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat. Horrible flight with disappointing staff.",Understaff Problems
87,"Held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff, allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trial.",Understaff Problems

105,I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA.,Understaff Problems
109,"The staff are friendly. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours"". Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd.",Understaff Problems
120,"The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient.",Understaff Problems
121,"Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers.",Understaff Problems
122,"Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.",Understaff Problems
124,The staff were no help and frankly rude.,Understaff Problems
129,"We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs.",Understaff Problems
132,In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers).,Understaff Problems

148,"Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me.",Understaff Problems
150,I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022.,Understaff Problems

155,The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals.,Understaff Problems
157,"I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to.",Understaff Problems
158,"Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready.",Understaff Problems
159,The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers.,Understaff Problems
160,"They change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do.",Understaff Problems
162,No staff to serve the waiting passengers.,Understaff Problems
165,"There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff.",Understaff Problems
166,While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!,Understaff Problems
167,"At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally.",Understaff Problems
171,"My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day.",Understaff Problems
174,Check in staff friendly but too few of them.,Understaff Problems
178,"The resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too.",Understaff Problems
181,"They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980!",Understaff Problems
182,"There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other.",Understaff Problems
183,"On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.",Understaff Problems
184,BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part.,Understaff Problems
185,No check in staff for Economy.,Understaff Problems

196,"Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane.",Understaff Problems
197,"At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy.",Understaff Problems
199,The staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me.,Understaff Problems
203,"There was no support, guidance or remorse from the staff.",Understaff Problems

235,Very stressful at least the staff were nice.,Understaff Problems
238,"My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage.",Understaff Problems
239,However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful.,Understaff Problems
240,The staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it.,Understaff Problems
242,They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers.,Understaff Problems

259,"2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff!",Understaff Problems
262,What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time?,Understaff Problems
263,"I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.",Understaff Problems
272,Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand.,Understaff Problems
277,Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.,Understaff Problems
280,"Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. I apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight.",Understaff Problems
286,The staff at check-in could not have been less helpful.,Understaff Problems
287,"We each had a carry on; however, during the transit process, British Airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags.",Understaff Problems
288,"As I arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).",Understaff Problems
290,In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat.,Understaff Problems

295,Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back.,Understaff Problems

299,"Waiting at gate, the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high.",Understaff Problems
310,"When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it.

314,"The flight then was pretty much okay, the food was delicious, had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks, the flight staff was kind and helpful.",Understaff Problems
315,"Old airplane, unhelpful staff. Delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays.",Understaff Problems
316,"On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.",Understaff Problems
320,The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt.,Understaff Problems
321,Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. They could have just got more staff there to begin with.,Understaff Problems
323,"Then, no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own.",Understaff Problems
325,"Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?).",Understaff Problems
331,The only complaint I have is about the ground staff at Heathrow. I lost my jacket on the Shanghai to London flight and ground staff at Heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects.,Understaff Problems
335,The BA staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on.,Understaff Problems
339,"I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift.",Understaff Problems
340,When i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. Staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful.,Understaff Problems

352,"The flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it.",Understaff Problems
353,"Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.",Understaff Problems
356,"The staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum.",Understaff Problems
360,"I paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English. Staff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain. The worst staff I had  met.",Understaff Problems
361,"Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",Understaff Problems
364,"Meal and drinks for purchase, uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight.",Understaff Problems

384,Flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down.,Understaff Problems
385,"Flight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality. Once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible.",Understaff Problems
388,They almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff.,Understaff Problems
395,The main difference with BA now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff I encountered.,Understaff Problems
398,"Both times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and uncooperative .I was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat.",Understaff Problems
400,Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored).,Understaff Problems
402,"I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help.",Understaff Problems
410,I saw an elderly Chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in BA uniform walked away and ignored them. No cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassed.,Understaff Problems
414,"I was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff.",Understaff Problems
416,"They have in the past left me stranded in Moscow for 5 days when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow, I have encountered rude staff on check in, long queues even for Executive members.",Understaff Problems
419,"No one took charge of our situation, information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel.",Understaff Problems
421,And Qatar Airways ground service staff show that they do care.,Understaff Problems
423,"The staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low BA had sunk, how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape!",Understaff Problems
430,It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore.,Understaff Problems

455,"The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"".",Understaff Problems
456,Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above - when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a co-worker that's the last of her problems.,Understaff Problems

460,I have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life!,Understaff Problems
463,"I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'.

476,"To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight. Staff have attitude across the board.",Understaff Problems

491,My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier.,Understaff Problems
498,"The seat was very uncomfortable, slow service from section cabin staff and  in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraft.",Understaff Problems

511,"The staff in the plane more less accabtable. I asked the staff, and at least they found my hand luggage. Recommendation to BA, staff behaved partly unacceptable.",Understaff Problems
514,"British Airways staff were no where to be found! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed.",Understaff Problems
517,"Ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths, refusing to change my seat because ""that's what the computer has allocated"". Cabin staff were rude and uncaring.",Understaff Problems
519,"When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Cabin staff were very good.",Understaff Problems
521,I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump.,Understaff Problems
524,"Whilst I would agree that the staff on AA see passengers as a necessary evil (particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy), the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging BA B747 aircraft.",Understaff Problems
525,I went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. To be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrong.,Understaff Problems
526,"I've had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfied.",Understaff Problems
528,Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff.,Understaff Problems
534,Check-in staff rude and arrogant and didn't explain the delay.,Understaff Problems
535,Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff.,Understaff Problems
537,"The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible.",Understaff Problems
542,"So why no extra staff to cope with this? Unbelievably, desk staffed by only one person.",Understaff Problems
543,"When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give.",Understaff Problems
545,Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move.,Understaff Problems
548,"The staff at Paris airport refused to check-in my piece of luggage on the continuing Avianca flight because I had not booked that ticket with BA. When I pointed out to the BA staff the impact this would have they said it was my fault for booking 2 separate tickets, and Avianca are not part of oneworld like BA, but in Star Alliance.",Understaff Problems
554,"when I arrived at Heathrow, I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. The flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg. Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight. No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.",Understaff Problems
555,"45 minutes later when trying to board flight, we were stopped and told we were now at the back of the plane with our tickets given to BA staff, who were sitting comfortably.",Understaff Problems
559,"The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately.",Understaff Problems
563,"The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant.",Understaff Problems
566,We had a long wait at a deserted Genoa airport and no British Airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food.,Understaff Problems
570,The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal.,Understaff Problems
581,"It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate.",Understaff Problems
582,"A problem with seat I had booked and paid extra for, ground staff said they had no authority - lots of phone calls nothing achieved, suggested I spoke with crew, understanding but pretty lack luster.",Understaff Problems
597,"The check-in person said they would try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate, but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay.",Understaff Problems
599,"Lost luggage office at Amsterdam was difficult to find, but staff were helpful.",Understaff Problems
600,"Worst experience I've ever had in an airport, poor organisation with bad customer service from British Airways staff who didn't care that I would have a 5 hour delay, due to been told I would need to cancel and rebook my conecting internal flight. No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight.",Understaff Problems
605,"The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift, the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The staff were better than the previous flight.",Understaff Problems
606,Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same.,Understaff Problems
607,"Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami.",Understaff Problems
610,Flight was delayed by more than 2 hours but ground staff were unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport options even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport options available.,Understaff Problems
616,"The staff were friendly and food was good, selection of films was more than satisfactory. I was appalled to see that there was no back up at all in the first place, but then we were told our baggage would be with us within two days by one of British Airways staff. The staff have been unhelpful and unwilling to aid us in finding our luggage, which has spoiled our holiday completely and left us in a dofficult situation with 4 children under 12.",Understaff Problems
617,We informed the ground staff.,Understaff Problems
618,"Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane).",Understaff Problems
619,"The seat that I had booked 24 hours in advance (a window seat) had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin, I complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full.",Understaff Problems
621,"The staff were great, food was pretty good, their seating policy is a sham.",Understaff Problems
623,"Service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best, and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines. The Purser, CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the PA announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t-d's.",Understaff Problems
626,"Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money, what does BA do? It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum.",Understaff Problems
627,"Their idea of an Asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and rice, drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away.",Understaff Problems
632,Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems.,Understaff Problems
