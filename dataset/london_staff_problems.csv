0,During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me.,Staff Problems
1,"I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped.",Staff Problems
2,Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow).,Staff Problems
3,Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules.,Staff Problems
4,"Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early.",Staff Problems
5,Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us.,Staff Problems
6,I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service.,Staff Problems
7,"The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund.",Staff Problems
8,The staff are very rude and not trained properly.,Staff Problems
10,Why don't you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand.,Staff Problems
11,"I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right.",Staff Problems
12,"Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly.",Staff Problems
13,On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers.,Staff Problems
17,"Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better.",Staff Problems
18,The ground staff were not helpful.,Staff Problems
19,The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed.,Staff Problems
20,"Denied wheelchair assistance at LHR for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot. Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05, 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water. When walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat. Horrible flight with disappointing staff.",Staff Problems
21,"Held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff, allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trial.",Staff Problems
23,"At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problems.",Staff Problems
25,Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge.,Staff Problems
26,I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA.,Staff Problems
27,"The staff are friendly. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours"". Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd.",Staff Problems
28,"The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient.",Staff Problems
29,"Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers.",Staff Problems
30,"Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.",Staff Problems
31,The staff were no help and frankly rude.,Staff Problems
32,"We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs.",Staff Problems
33,In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers).,Staff Problems
34,"We asked BA staff for refund, told cannot do but will issue vouchers.",Staff Problems
35,"At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day.",Staff Problems
36,"Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are ""very busy right now"" and our baggage will arrive ""soon.""",Staff Problems
37,"Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me.",Staff Problems
38,I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022.,Staff Problems
39,"Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked.",Staff Problems
40,The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals.,Staff Problems
41,"I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to.",Staff Problems
42,"Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready.",Staff Problems
43,The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers.,Staff Problems
44,"They change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do.",Staff Problems
45,No staff to serve the waiting passengers.,Staff Problems
46,"There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff.",Staff Problems
47,While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!,Staff Problems
48,"At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally.",Staff Problems
49,"My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day.",Staff Problems
50,Check in staff friendly but too few of them.,Staff Problems
51,"The resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too.",Staff Problems
52,"They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980!",Staff Problems
53,"There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other.",Staff Problems
54,"On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.",Staff Problems
55,BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part.,Staff Problems
56,No check in staff for Economy.,Staff Problems
57,I recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff weren't interested in helping me return home.,Staff Problems
59,British Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime.,Staff Problems
60,"I have now called this number five times, each time I was told to call at another time, as 'in these difficult times, they had to protect staff'.",Staff Problems
61,"Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane.",Staff Problems
62,"At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy.",Staff Problems
63,The staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me.,Staff Problems
64,"There was no support, guidance or remorse from the staff.",Staff Problems
65,The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston.,Staff Problems
66,"We had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up. Once they did, the staff were surly and rude.",Staff Problems
67,Service bad from staff. For the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.,Staff Problems
68,Very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases.,Staff Problems
69,Rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 GBP.,Staff Problems
70,The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do.,Staff Problems
71,Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff.,Staff Problems
72,"I arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed, I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have to leave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the plane.",Staff Problems
73,A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude.,Staff Problems
74,Very stressful at least the staff were nice.,Staff Problems
75,"My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage.",Staff Problems
76,However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful.,Staff Problems
77,The staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it.,Staff Problems
78,They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers.,Staff Problems
79,It’s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers.,Staff Problems
80,BA staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins.,Staff Problems
81,The airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed.,Staff Problems
82,I arrived 3 hours before flight where I waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency.,Staff Problems
83,"But as I landed at Delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking.",Staff Problems
84,"2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff!",Staff Problems
85,What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time?,Staff Problems
86,"I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.",Staff Problems
87,Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand.,Staff Problems
88,Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.,Staff Problems
89,"Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. I apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight.",Staff Problems
90,The staff at check-in could not have been less helpful.,Staff Problems
91,"We each had a carry on; however, during the transit process, British Airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags.",Staff Problems
92,"As I arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).",Staff Problems
93,In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat.,Staff Problems
94,"The staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology.",Staff Problems
95,Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back.,Staff Problems
96,"The plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable, there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish.",Staff Problems
97,"Waiting at gate, the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high.",Staff Problems
98,"When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"".",Staff Problems
99,"The flight then was pretty much okay, the food was delicious, had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks, the flight staff was kind and helpful.",Staff Problems
100,"Old airplane, unhelpful staff. Delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays.",Staff Problems
101,"On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.",Staff Problems
102,The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt.,Staff Problems
103,Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. They could have just got more staff there to begin with.,Staff Problems
104,"Then, no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own.",Staff Problems
105,"Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?).",Staff Problems
106,The only complaint I have is about the ground staff at Heathrow. I lost my jacket on the Shanghai to London flight and ground staff at Heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects.,Staff Problems
107,The BA staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on.,Staff Problems
108,"I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift.",Staff Problems
109,When i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. Staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful.,Staff Problems

114,The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them.,Staff Problems
115,"The flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it.",Staff Problems
116,"Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.",Staff Problems
117,"The staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum.",Staff Problems
119,"I paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English. Staff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain. The worst staff I had  met.",Staff Problems
120,"Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",Staff Problems
121,"Meal and drinks for purchase, uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight.",Staff Problems
122,Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. This was quite hard on the staff.,Staff Problems
123,Their lounge at DUS is closed but their check-in staff doesn't know that (she sent me up there).,Staff Problems
124,"I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected. Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest, the supervisor particularly).",Staff Problems
127,There stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff.,Staff Problems
128,Flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down.,Staff Problems
129,"Flight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality. Once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible.",Staff Problems
130,They almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff.,Staff Problems
132,The main difference with BA now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff I encountered.,Staff Problems
133,"Both times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and uncooperative .I was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat.",Staff Problems
134,Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored).,Staff Problems
135,"I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help.",Staff Problems
136,I saw an elderly Chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in BA uniform walked away and ignored them. No cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassed.,Staff Problems
138,"I was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff.",Staff Problems
139,"They have in the past left me stranded in Moscow for 5 days when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow, I have encountered rude staff on check in, long queues even for Executive members.",Staff Problems
141,"No one took charge of our situation, information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel.",Staff Problems
142,And Qatar Airways ground service staff show that they do care.,Staff Problems
143,"The staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low BA had sunk, how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape!",Staff Problems
144,It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore.,Staff Problems
145,"Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what.",Staff Problems
146,"Terrible service all round, the airline has gone down and staff really don't care - especially in heathrow baggage office.",Staff Problems
147,The staff were not even nice about it.,Staff Problems
148,After pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to Bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination New Delhi.,Staff Problems
149,"When I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to Zone E to get a Boarding pass printed by the counter staff, after waiting 20 minutes in the queue (bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off) I was told that the flight has been closed and as I was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and I ca not fly on that flight so I will have to take the next one (from 8am flight I was moved to 11am flight).",Staff Problems
150,"Even with boarding pass pre-arranged, there is no Bag drop in Montreal, just one long line, British Airways BA staff.",Staff Problems
151,"The staff are surly and abrupt, the seating cramped and uncomfortable.",Staff Problems
152,"The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"".",Staff Problems
153,Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above - when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a co-worker that's the last of her problems.,Staff Problems
154,On the return journey I noticed part of the reason for this new policy: the Stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff.,Staff Problems
155,Arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and I didn't get our seats together - ground staff could do nothing about it.,Staff Problems
156,I have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life!,Staff Problems
157,"I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'. I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff.",Staff Problems
158,I checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that I immediately ripped off.,Staff Problems

160,Poor communications from LHR British Airways staff.,Staff Problems
161,British Airways were completely under staffed and disorganised. Staff are old and 'entitled'.,Staff Problems
162,"To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight. Staff have attitude across the board.",Staff Problems

166,They ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought I would not make it.,Staff Problems
167,On this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers.,Staff Problems
168,When I asked the BA staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting £5 worth of voucher.,Staff Problems
169,"From disruption in the cabin the like of which I have never witnessed on any airline other than British Airways, to delays on nearly all BA flights I have taken in 2016, rude, surly staff that act like BA was still a 1970's state enterprise.",Staff Problems
170,My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier.,Staff Problems
171,"The seat was very uncomfortable, slow service from section cabin staff and  in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraft.",Staff Problems
172,"Very grumpy and abrupt staff and the meal, if you can call it that, was a sandwich and a small coffee in a paper cup.",Staff Problems

176,"I could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying ""I have called them and they are not listening so I am not doing it anymore"".",Staff Problems
177,"The staff in the plane more less accabtable. I asked the staff, and at least they found my hand luggage. Recommendation to BA, staff behaved partly unacceptable.",Staff Problems
178,"British Airways staff were no where to be found! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed.",Staff Problems
179,"Ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths, refusing to change my seat because ""that's what the computer has allocated"". Cabin staff were rude and uncaring.",Staff Problems
180,"When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Cabin staff were very good.",Staff Problems
181,I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump.,Staff Problems
182,"Whilst I would agree that the staff on AA see passengers as a necessary evil (particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy), the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging BA B747 aircraft.",Staff Problems
183,I went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. To be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrong.,Staff Problems
184,"I've had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfied.",Staff Problems
185,Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff.,Staff Problems
187,Check-in staff rude and arrogant and didn't explain the delay.,Staff Problems
188,Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff.,Staff Problems
189,"The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible.",Staff Problems
192,"So why no extra staff to cope with this? Unbelievably, desk staffed by only one person.",Staff Problems
193,"When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give.",Staff Problems
194,Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move.,Staff Problems
195,"The staff at Paris airport refused to check-in my piece of luggage on the continuing Avianca flight because I had not booked that ticket with BA. When I pointed out to the BA staff the impact this would have they said it was my fault for booking 2 separate tickets, and Avianca are not part of oneworld like BA, but in Star Alliance.",Staff Problems
196,"when I arrived at Heathrow, I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. The flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg. Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight. No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.",Staff Problems
197,"45 minutes later when trying to board flight, we were stopped and told we were now at the back of the plane with our tickets given to BA staff, who were sitting comfortably.",Staff Problems
198,"The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately.",Staff Problems
199,"The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant.",Staff Problems
200,We had a long wait at a deserted Genoa airport and no British Airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food.,Staff Problems
201,The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal.,Staff Problems
202,"It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate.",Staff Problems
203,"A problem with seat I had booked and paid extra for, ground staff said they had no authority - lots of phone calls nothing achieved, suggested I spoke with crew, understanding but pretty lack luster.",Staff Problems
204,"The check-in person said they would try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate, but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay.",Staff Problems
205,"Lost luggage office at Amsterdam was difficult to find, but staff were helpful.",Staff Problems
206,"Worst experience I've ever had in an airport, poor organisation with bad customer service from British Airways staff who didn't care that I would have a 5 hour delay, due to been told I would need to cancel and rebook my conecting internal flight. No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight.",Staff Problems
207,"The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift, the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The staff were better than the previous flight.",Staff Problems
208,Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same.,Staff Problems
209,"Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami.",Staff Problems
210,Flight was delayed by more than 2 hours but ground staff were unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport options even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport options available.,Staff Problems
212,"The staff were friendly and food was good, selection of films was more than satisfactory. I was appalled to see that there was no back up at all in the first place, but then we were told our baggage would be with us within two days by one of British Airways staff. The staff have been unhelpful and unwilling to aid us in finding our luggage, which has spoiled our holiday completely and left us in a dofficult situation with 4 children under 12.",Staff Problems
213,We informed the ground staff.,Staff Problems
214,"Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane).",Staff Problems
215,"The seat that I had booked 24 hours in advance (a window seat) had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin, I complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full.",Staff Problems
216,"The staff were great, food was pretty good, their seating policy is a sham.",Staff Problems
217,"Service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best, and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines. The Purser, CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the PA announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t-d's.",Staff Problems
218,"Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money, what does BA do? It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum.",Staff Problems
219,"Their idea of an Asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and rice, drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away.",Staff Problems
220,Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems.,Staff Problems
